.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Sy appjail healthcheck
utility creates a healthchecker to supervise the jail's health. Technically it supervise
whether a healthchecker runs correctly or not, so it checks the health of each healthchecker,
not the jail, but we can assume that if a healthchecker fails, it's probably that the jail or
the application running inside the jail will get the same result.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width xxx
.It Cm get Oo Fl eHIipt Oc Fl n Ar nro Ar jail
Get information about current healthcheckers
.Ns , that is, the
.Ar keyword
that represent the information to be obtained. Multiple keywords can be specified,
which are displayed as a table-like interface in the order in which they are specified.
.No If no Ar keyword No is specified, the defaults are Sy nro Ns , Sy enabled Ns , Sy name Ns , Sy status Ns , Sy health_cmd No and Sy recover_cmd Ns "."
.Pp
See
.Sx KEYWORDS
for a list of available keywords.
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width xx
.It Fl e
Not required when using
.Fl p
.Ns "."
The
.Sy \et
character is used to delimit columns,
so as not to show strange values, this option shows
.Sy <TAB>
instead of
.Sy \et
in the case that a value contains the latter.
.It Fl H
Shows the name of the columns.
.It Fl I
Include empty values. By default, a minus sign is displayed when a value is empty.
.It Fl i
Don't complain when
.Ar nro
doesn't exist.
.It Fl p
Columnate the list.
.It Fl t
Tabulate columns and values.
.It Fl n Ar nro
Identifier.
.El
.It Cm list Oo Fl eHIipt Oc Oo Fl n Ar nro Oc Ar jail
.No Similar to Cm get No but shows each Ar keyword No for each healthchecker in a nice table.
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width xx
.It Fl e Ns , Fl H Ns , Fl I Ns , Fl p Ns , Fl t
.No All of these options perform the opposite task of the options described in Cm get Ns "."
.It Fl i
Perform the same task as described in
.Cm get
.Ns "."
.It Fl n Ar nro
.No Only show information for Ar nro Ns "."
.El
.It Cm remove Oo Cm all Ns | Ns Cm nro Ar nro Oc Ar jail
Remove a given healthchecker.
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width xx
.It Cm all
Remove all healthcheckers.
.It Cm nro Ar nro
Remove the healthchecker specified by
.Ar nro
.Ns "."
.El
.It Cm run Ar jail
Run enabled healthcheckers in foreground.
.Pp
Note that you should run this subcommand only for debugging, although you can view the log that
.Xr appjail-startup 1
generates for this purpose. See
.Xr appjail-logs 1
for more details.
.Pp
One misconception is that you might think that healthcheckers work forever. They
were not designed with this in mind because a service that constantly crashes is
useless and should be fixed as soon as possible. What Healthcheckers do is inform
you when the command they run fails and attempts to repair the service they supervise
time out, but all of this works within limits defined by the
.Cm set
subcommand.

parameter is used.
.It Fl l Ar signal

.Fl u Ns "."
If this option is not set, the signal specified
by the
.Sy DEFAULT_RECOVER_TIMEOUT_SIGNAL
parameter is used.
.It Fl N Ar name
Healthchecker name.
.It Fl n Ar nro
Identifier. An identifier is composed of a positive number. Use
.Cm auto
.Pq default
to get the lowest identifier value.
.It Fl R Ar number

specified by
.Fl r Ns "."
If this option is not set, the number specified by the

.Ar command
with
.Sy host:
to run the command from the host or with
.Sy jail:
to run the command from the jail. If no prefix is specified, the default value
is the one specified by the

parameter.
.Pp
If the keyword
.Sy %j
is in
.Ar command Ns ,
it will be replaced by the jail name.

.Fl t Ns "."
If this option is not set, the signal specified by the
.Sy DEFAULT_TIMEOUT_SIGNAL
parameter is used.
.It Fl s Ar seconds

by the
.Sy DEFAULT_HEALTH_START_PERIOD

specified by the
.Sy DEFAULT_HEALTH_TIMEOUT
parameter is used.
.It Fl u Ar seconds
Send the signal specified by
.Fl l
to the process created by the command specified by

.Sh HOW HEALTHCHECKERS WORK
All healthcheckers run in parallel and are described step by step as follows:
.Pp
.Bl -enum
.It
Set the status to
.Sy starting "."
.It
If the
.Sy start period
is greater than
.Sy 0 ","
the process sleeps for the indicated seconds.
.It
Sleep the process for the given interval.
.It
Execute the
.Sy health command "."
If the
.Sy health type
is
.Sy host Ns , it executes the given command on the host, otherwise if it is
.Sy jail
it executes the command on the jail.
.It
If the timeout
.Pq in seconds
is reached, the signal configured for the
.Sy health command
is sent.
.It
The
.Sy SIGKILL
signal is sent to the
.Sy health command
when its
.Sy kill after
.Pq in seconds
is reached. You should probably set it to be greater than its
.Sy timeout "."
.It
If the
.Sy health command
is successful, set the status to
.Sy healthy
and repeat step
.Sy 3 Ns , otherwise set the status to
.Sy failing
and if the current
.Sy retry count
is reached, continue with step 8, otherwise continue with step 3.
.It
If the current total of recoveries is reached, set the status to
.Sy unhealthy
and close the healthchecker, otherwise add one to the recovery count and continue with step 9.
.It
Execute the
.Sy recover command "."
If the
.Sy recover type
is
.Sy host ","
it executes the given command on the host, otherwise if it is
.Sy jail
it executes the command on the jail.
.It
If the
.Sy timeout
.Pq in seconds
is reached, the signal configured for the
.Sy recover command
is sent.
.It
The
.Sy SIGKILL
signal is sent to the
.Sy recover command
when its
.Sy kill after
.Pq in seconds
is reached. You should probably set it to be greater than its
.Sy timeout "."
.It
If the
.Sy recover command
fails, set the status to
.Sy unhealthy
and close the healthchecker, otherwise set the status to
.Sy healthy
and continue with step 3.
.El
.Sh KEYWORDS
.Bl -tag -width xx
.It Sy nro
Identifier.

if it is not.
