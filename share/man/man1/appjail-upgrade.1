.Sy appjail upgrade

release.

.Sy appjail upgrade
can't upgrade a jail or a release that comes from an empty release or a build from
the FreeBSD source tree. In the case of jails, only thick jails can be upgraded.

.It Fl u
Fetch files necessary for upgrading a release to a new FreeBSD release. By default, the release specified by the
.Sy DEFAULT_RELEASE
parameter is used.
.Pp
Since there is a possibility that existing thin jails are still using the old release,
this parameter makes a copy of the release with the version and architecture you specified
and performs the upgrade using it. The release with the previous version remains intact.
.Pp
If a failed upgrade is detected, this option continues by removing the release that
matches the new version to perform the upgrade again.
.It Fl n Ar new-release
Specify the new release
.Pq e.g., 11.2-RELEASE
to which
.Xr freebsd-update 8
should upgrade.
