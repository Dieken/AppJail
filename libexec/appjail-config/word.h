 * Creates a new instance of `word` and assigns it to `wptr`. `trbck` is the trace

 *
 * This function parses `s` to get words. One or more words are separated by spaces.
 * To use spaces in words, the word can be enclosed in single or double quotes.
 * Single and double quotes can be escaped using an escape character. An escape
 * character followed by a character other than the quotation mark (depending on
 * whether it is single or double) will write without escaping.
 *
 * Examples:
 *   - "Hello world!" "Escaping \""
 *     ```
 *     Hello world!
 *     Escaping "
 *     ```
 *   - 'Hello :D' '\"':

 *     Hello :D
 *     \"
